## Getting Started

Haskell is a pure functional, statically (implicitly) typed, lazy language.

From a [Haskell review](https://bytes.yingw787.com/posts/2020/01/30/a_review_of_haskell/): 

"My appreciation of programming as an art and as a discipline increased by my learning Haskell, at the cost of my brain constantly melting out my ears and my eyeballs not comprehending what I was reading."

```
# loading source code from MyCode.hs to GHCI:

ghci
-- load code-file
:load MyCode

-- show type
:t expr

-- show info
:i symbol
```
